# Sincerely Sharon Blog
I created this website for my friend, Sharon. She's been writing blog articles for 
several years now on Wix and recently ran out of storage space for her images. 
In order to provide her with the ability to update the website independently in a 
user friendly way, I set up this blog to draw from a Notion database of pages.

## Details
This website is made with NextJS, Tailwind CSS, and is hosted on Vercel.

## Credit
To create this site, I used [this](https://reactjsexample.com/next-js-blog-template-that-uses-notion-as-cms/) template for interacting with the NotionX API.
