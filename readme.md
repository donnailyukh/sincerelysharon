# Sincerely Sharon Blog
I created this website for my friend, Sharon. She's been writing blog articles for 
several years now on Wix and recently ran out of storage space for her images. 
She has the ability to update the website independently in a 
user friendly way without hvaing to edit the code herself or ask me for help!
In order to acheive this, I set up this site to use Notion as a content managment system. 
Sharon can simply add her articles to Notion database of pages and they'll be reflected on the site.

## Details
This website is made with NextJS, Tailwind CSS, and is hosted on Vercel.

## Credit
To create this site, I used [this](https://reactjsexample.com/next-js-blog-template-that-uses-notion-as-cms/) template for interacting with the NotionX API.
